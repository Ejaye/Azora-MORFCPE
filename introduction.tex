\section{Background of the Study}
RC or remote controlled cars became popular as a toy. The procedure works using radio control. It is done by sending commands from the radio controller to the receiver which is the car. There are four significant parts of any radio controlled device and those are the transmitters, receivers, motors and power source. The transmitter is the control thus sending the radio waves to a receiver. The receiver uses an antenna with a circuit inside to receive signals from the sender and triggers the motors to move. The motors then control the wheels and can manipulate the direction of the car. The power source from the name itself provides power to the car to be operative. 
Remote controlled cars may not only be just toys, they can have other purposes like making the car also a transmitter. One way to utilize that ability is by using an application. This time, we use a smartphone as a transmitter that can send different signals to the receiver with corresponding commands. Through the use of a module that can be used as the center of connection, the communication between a smartphone and any other devices with receivers is possible. 



\section{Prior Studies}
A research conducted by Campolo, Claudia, et al. (2012) uses a smartphone as a platform to control a car and support traffic management. This is to add new services for the passengers and drivers. They have studied that with the growing technology and that smartphone is one of the most useful for experiment. Also they recognized that cars can be the most efficient way to collect data through surroundings. Sensors are installed in the cars to monitor parameters like temperature and amount of pollution. 
In our present time, technology has grown much faster. One part of technology that keeps on improving is the internet. Because of that intelligent homes were born. This intelligent home system brings user a safer more comfortable place to live in. This program is based on wireless technology that comprise of wifi, mobile communications and zigbee. The project system contains both the hardware and software. The appliances are fixed with sensors and CC2530 chip. The interconnection of the different devices and appliances are interfaced with RS232 and RS485. The interface can be on devices like the tablet or the smartphones or even in personal computers. The commands and software related things can be accomplished by platforms like android and eclipse. One feature is that it can measure how an elderly is feeling. This works by determining how fit or well the elder is while he/she is alone in a house. The results were reliable because the information gathered by the sensors comes with small errors. The owners themselves were satisfied in the testing result. The intelligent home system will soon be widely applied and called the future of smart homes(Zhenghua, Xin, et al., 2014).

\section{Problem Statement}
Nowadays many are having problems to go to certain locations due to harsh environment, life risking places etc. But still need to go due to certain conditions for example going for search and rescue during calamities. Many are trying to still do these but having their lives at risk as well is a very problematic problem. When a certain calamity arises in order to reach certain places many volunteers are needed or when you want to go to an expedition but you are not sure whether the terrain you are going to set foot on is safe you will need to have a volunteer to check the upcoming surrounding first. With these in mind, robotic applications can be made in order to ease the tasks that are required also people can fully equip the robot with the technology needed to do certain tasks to ensure less risks and casualties.
	By making use of a remote controlled robot people can avoid dangerous tasks or expeditions in areas that are hard to traverse.

\section{Significance of the Study}
	It has been difficult for people to take safety precautions when going to unknown lands. It has been very harsh especially when going to narrow places and dangerous places especially when there are natural calamities such as typhoons or when going an expedition when tackling unknown terrains especially in mountains and forests, people cannot reach or justify whether the place is safe to proceed or not. But autonomous robots have limitations especially when it comes to specifics like controlling the robots precisely. Manual control bypasses this problem by shifting the controls to the user and also allows for a more direct approach on tasks. Controlling the robot using android to explore uncertain terrain is what this proposal is about.

	 This proposal aims to build a rover for multi terrain purposes that can be further enhanced for search and rescue operations or discovering unexplored territory. The rover can be navigated on different types of land giving it a wider range of area to explore.

	This proposal also features wireless control over the rover using Android through ZigBee. Having these wireless features will enable it to reach farther than a wired one. It can transmit and receive data from computer and controller in real time basis depending on the enhanced modification.
